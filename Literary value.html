They were usually covered in ancient Bosnian writing, which usually revealed who was buried under it, and some of their achievements. The epitaphs have a great artistic value because of their characteristic form and style, and they continue to inspire poets from all over the globe. The famous Bosnian poet Mak Dizdar was so inspired by their writings; he dedicated all his songs to the unique style of Bosnian tombstones. </p>
                 <p> Besides writing, stećci were also decorated with different reliefs, which usually have great symbolic value. The relief also depicted different events, like tourneys and hunting trips. Besides literature, Bosnian tombstones have been very useful in the field of archeology, since Bosnian tombstones are the main source of information for discovering new things about the medieval Bosnian kingdom.</p>
